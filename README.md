## Features

List the key of features of MRT-J-Revamp:

-   Modern Design (SwiftUI): The app boasts a clean and intuitive interface designed with SwiftUI, making navigation and information access effortless.

-   Seamless Ticketing: Forget physical tickets! Users can purchase tickets directly within the app and generate unique barcodes using CoreImage.

-   Barcode-Based Entry and Exit (CoreLocation): Simply scan the displayed barcode at entry and exit gates. The app leverages CoreLocation to verify user proximity to MRT terminals and ensure ticket validity.

-   One-Time Entry (Current Stage): For now, each barcode is valid for a single entry. Future development plans to address re-entry with dynamic barcode updates.

-   Real-Time Train Schedules: Stay informed with up-to-date train schedules displayed directly within the app.

-   Smart Navigation (CoreLocation): Never miss a stop! CoreLocation pinpoints the user's location and suggests the closest MRT terminal.
